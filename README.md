Epigenetic Mechanisms in Marine Invertebrates: Perspectives and Applications


Abstract:

Epigenetics has attracted considerable attention with respect to its potential value in many areas of agricultural production, particularly under conditions where the environment can be manipulated or natural variation exists. The function of DNA methylation in shellfish where the limited amount of DNA methylation is predominantly found in gene bodies is not completely understood. One emerging possible explanation is that the role of gene body DNA methylation is dependent on gene function, a potential phenomenon that has arisen from selective pressure on lineage-specific life history traits. We know that in other taxa epigenetic marks are associated with phenotypes independent of genetic variation, the environment can influence DNA methylation, and epigenetic marks can be inherited. Specific case studies will be presented including looking at the role of DNA methylation in genomic regulatory function and heredity in oysters, and investigating the underpinnings of environmental memory in clams. These combined data suggest the application of epigenetic knowledge could significantly affect the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture practices.

It is increasingly evident that environmental perturbations can have impacts on marine invertebrates beyond acute exposure periods. In some instances this might manifest as an adult phenotype that is associated with an early-life stage exposure event. There is also the case where parental environmental exposures can influence offspring phenotype. The processes involved in these intergenerational carryover effects can be diverse in nature, and can be related to physiological compromise in adults that results in negative effects linked to poor quality gametes or insufficient maternal resource allocation. However, in some cases an environmental perturbation experienced by parents might result in a positive effect in offspring, such as improved performance upon secondary exposure to the condition experienced by the parents. Results from recent experiments looking at intergenerational carryover effects in oysters (Ostrea and Crassostrea) and geoduck clams will be presented. Specific environmental condtions examined include temperture, diet, and seawater pH. In addition, preliminary data will be discussed in terms of a role for DNA methylation as a mechanisms for environmental memory within and across generations.
